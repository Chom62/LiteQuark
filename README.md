What is LiteQuark (LTQ)?

LiteQuark is the result of merging Litecoin with the super secure hashing power of Quarkcoin.  It uses the super secure 'quark' algorithm made up of 9 rounds of hashing from 6 hashing functions (blake, bmw, grøstl, JH, keccak, skein). 3 rounds apply a random hashing function. LTQ has a block time of 30 seconds and block rewards of 2.5 LTQ per block. The block rewards will never fall below 0.1 LTQ. Retargeting every block using DarkGravityWave3 and halving every 4 years. LTQ is CPU mined and ASIC resistant, so anyone can mine it without the need of running expensive high-end hardware.

⦁              Algorithm: Quark 
⦁              Block Time: 30 seconds 
⦁              Block Rewards: 2.5 LTQ 
⦁              Block Minimum Rewards: 0.1 LTQ 
⦁              Block Halving: Every 4 years 
⦁              Retarget Time: every block via DGW3 
⦁              Total LTQ: 21,000,000 + 105,120 LTQ Annual Inflation After Initial 21,000,000 mined 
⦁              CPU Mined, ASIC Resistant
